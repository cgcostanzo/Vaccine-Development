# **Vaccine Development**

Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a deadly, highly invasive bacterium endemic in many regions globally. Currently classified by the WHO as a reemerging pathogen, plague outbreaks are increasing with climate change and rodent carrier range shifts. Y. pestis is classified as a Tier 1 select agent by the CDC due to its bioterrorism potential and high mortality rate. Dangerous multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Y. pestis occur naturally or have been developed intentionally as a biothreat agent. As there is no FDA-approved human plague vaccine, there is a critical need for new-generation plague vaccine development. This project aims to contribute to this need by assessing the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses induced by the Chimpanzee adenovirus-based plague vaccine ChAdOx1 developed by Oxford University, UK, in collaboration with UTMB in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model as this is closest to humans.
